# apptv

apptv is an experiment to clone the User Interface and Experience of Apple TV and bring it to the web.

When you open it, you see the home screen. You can click any application icon to open. Keyboard navigation is supported (left-right-top-down or wasd to navigate, Enter to open the application, and Esc to close). There are two functioning apps:

- Wolforator, which is a calculator application; and
- Catyminders, which is a Reminders-style to-do app.
- The rest of the applications listed are mere placeholders.
